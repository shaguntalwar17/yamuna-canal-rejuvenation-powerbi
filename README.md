# Yamuna Canal Rejuvenation – Power BI Project

## Project Overview
Rivers in India are widely regarded as life-givers, sustaining communities, ecosystems, and livelihoods.  
This project presents a **data-driven environmental analysis** of the Yamuna Canal, using official **CPCB water-quality monitoring data** to evaluate ecological stress, pollution trends, and priority intervention zones.

The goal of the project is to move beyond static reporting and enable **actionable insights** that support responsible rejuvenation and long-term environmental stewardship.

## Objectives
- Assess the water quality status of the Yamuna Canal using key ecological indicators  
- Analyze year-wise and station-wise trends across monitoring locations  
- Identify pollution hotspots and non-compliant stretches  
- Support evidence-based decision-making for canal rejuvenation efforts  

---

## Key Indicators Analyzed
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)** – indicator of aquatic ecosystem health  
- **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)** – measure of organic pollution and sewage load  
- **Total Coliform** – indicator of microbial contamination and public health risk  
- **pH** – supporting indicator for chemical balance  

These parameters are evaluated against **national water-quality standards** to highlight compliance gaps and critical zones.

---

## Key Insights
- Several canal stretches exhibit **critically low DO levels**, indicating stressed and degraded aquatic conditions.  
- **BOD values significantly exceed permissible limits**, pointing to sustained organic pollution and untreated sewage inflow.  
- **Total Coliform levels remain extremely high**, reflecting severe microbial contamination and unsafe water conditions.  
- Pollution hotspots are spatially concentrated, enabling **targeted intervention rather than uniform action**.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – dashboard development and visualization  
- **Power Query** – data extraction, cleaning, and transformation  
- **DAX** – KPIs, compliance metrics, and trend analysis  
- **LaTeX** – structured and professional report documentation  
- **Environmental Data Analytics & Storytelling**

## Data Notes & Limitations
- The analysis is based on **publicly available CPCB monitoring data**.  
- Values reflect **reported and aggregated measurements**, not real-time conditions.  
- Seasonal and flow-based variations are not fully captured in annual aggregates.  

These limitations are acknowledged to ensure **transparent and responsible interpretation**.

## Why This Project Matters
Healthy rivers are foundational to environmental sustainability, public health, and economic resilience.  
By converting complex monitoring data into **clear, interpretable insights**, this project demonstrates how data analytics can contribute meaningfully to environmental protection and informed policy action.
